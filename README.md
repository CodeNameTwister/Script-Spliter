### V0.2
The internal workflow has been modified, but the functionality of its predecessor version has been maintained.

This has been done to maintain compatibility when using shorteners like Ctrl + [1, 2, 3, 4] to change the split style, this might be broken in version 0.3, see the roadmap for details.

differences with version 0.1:
* It more closely resembles the default editor window.
* Reduces window switching time.
* Allows you to zoom in on all windows.
* You may have a separate script documentation help window.
* Some visual aspects and configurable parameters in Editor Settings.
* More Features and Split Options.

>[!NOTE]
>This plugin uses another built-in plugin created by me called [Multi Split Container](https://github.com/CodeNameTwister/Multi-Split-Container)
